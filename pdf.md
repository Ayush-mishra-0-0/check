# Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis of Video Text Dataset

## Introduction

The video text dataset under analysis contains three main components:
1. Emotion data
2. Gaze data
3. Transcript data

Each component provides unique insights into student behavior and communication patterns during video recordings.

## Data Overview

### Emotion Data

The emotion data captures the emotional states of students throughout the video sequences. It includes the following features:
- Image sequence
- Emotional states (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral)
- Dominant emotion

### Gaze Data

The gaze data provides information about the students' eye movements and attention patterns:
- Image sequence
- Gaze direction
- Blink status
- Eye offset

### Transcript Data

The transcript data offers insights into the verbal communication of students:
- Timestamp information (id, seek, start, end)
- Text content
- Speech characteristics (temperature, avg_logprob, compression_ratio, no_speech_prob)
- Emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)
- Communication style (confident, hesitant, concise, enthusiastic)
- Speech speed

## Data Preprocessing

To ensure data quality and prepare for analysis, the following preprocessing steps were implemented:
1. Handling Missing Values: Imputation techniques applied based on feature type.
2. Encoding Categorical Features: Conversion to numeric form using label or one-hot encoding.
3. Scaling and Normalization: Applied to ensure feature comparability.
4. Outlier Detection and Treatment: IQR or z-score methods used to identify and treat outliers.
5. Feature Selection: Dimensionality reduction through correlation analysis and variance thresholding.
6. Data Splitting: Creation of training and testing sets for model evaluation.
7. Balancing Data: Techniques like SMOTE applied to handle class imbalance.
8. Removing Duplicates: Ensured dataset integrity by eliminating duplicate entries.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix was generated to identify relationships between various features:

![Correlation Matrix of Features](images/corr.png)

**Key Findings**:
- Strong positive correlation between average positive score and average confidence score (œÅ ‚âà 0.9)
- Moderate positive correlation between average hesitant score and average negative score (œÅ ‚âà 0.77)
- Moderate positive correlation between average enthusiastic score and average confident score
- Strong negative correlation between average negative score and average confident score (œÅ ‚âà -0.73)

**Interpretation**: These correlations suggest that students with more positive speech content tend to exhibit higher confidence and enthusiasm. Conversely, students with more negative speech content tend to show higher hesitancy and lower confidence.

### Distribution Analysis

Distribution plots were generated for various features to understand their spread and central tendencies. For example:

**Observation**: The distribution of average positive scores appears to be slightly right-skewed, with a mean around 0.65 and a range from approximately 0.55 to 0.75.

### Speech Speed vs. Hesitant Score Analysis

![Speech Speed vs. Hesitant Scores](images/speech_speed_vs_hesitant.png)

**Key Findings**:
- Students exhibiting sadness or fear tend to have either very slow or very fast speech speeds.
- There appears to be a slight positive correlation between speech speed and hesitancy, particularly for students with neutral or happy dominant emotions.

## Advanced Analysis

### Confidence Group Comparison

| Metric                 | High-Confidence | Low-Confidence |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Average Positivity     | 0.68            | 0.63           |
| Average Enthusiasm     | 0.45            | 0.38           |
| Average Speech Speed   | 3.1             | 2.8            |

**Interpretation**: High-confidence students tend to exhibit higher positivity, enthusiasm, and slightly faster speech compared to low-confidence students.

### Enthusiasm and Neutrality

- Number of enthusiastic students with neutral text score: 3

**Implication**: This suggests that enthusiasm in speech delivery can be present even when the content is neutral, highlighting the importance of non-verbal communication cues.

### Positive, Confident, and Enthusiastic Analysis

- Students who are positive, confident, enthusiastic, with normal speech speed and low hesitance: 2
- Students who are positive and confident: 5
- Students who are positive and enthusiastic: 4
- Students who are positive but not concise: 1
- Students who are positive and confident but not concise: 1
- Students who are confident but not positive: 0

**Interpretation**: These results indicate that positivity often coincides with confidence and enthusiasm, but conciseness may not always be present in positive and confident speakers.

## Statistical Analysis

### T-test: Confident vs Hesitant Scores

- t-statistic = 5.0353
- p-value = 0.0001

**Conclusion**: The extremely low p-value (p < 0.05) suggests a statistically significant difference between confident and hesitant scores.

### ANOVA: Positive Emotion Across Speech Speeds

- F-statistic = 0.8520
- p-value = 0.4665

**Conclusion**: The high p-value (p > 0.05) indicates no statistically significant relationship between positive emotion and speech speeds.

## Feature Importance

![Feature Importance for Predicting Speech Speed](images/feature_importance.png)

**Key Insight**: Hesitance and enthusiasm appear to be the most important features for predicting speech speed, suggesting that these emotional states have a strong influence on the pace of speech delivery.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis of the video text dataset has revealed several significant patterns and relationships among emotional and communication attributes of students:

1. üîç Strong correlation between confidence and positive emotions
2. üìä Statistically significant difference between confident and hesitant scores
3. üó£Ô∏è No significant relationship between positive emotions and speech speed
4. üèÜ Hesitance and enthusiasm as the most important predictors of speech speed

These insights provide valuable information for understanding student behavior and can be utilized to optimize educational strategies, particularly in the context of video-based learning and assessment.

## Future Work

To further enhance this analysis, consider the following directions for future research:
1. üî¨ Conduct longitudinal studies to track changes in student communication patterns over time
2. ü§ñ Develop machine learning models to predict student performance based on communication attributes
3. üéì Investigate the impact of different teaching methodologies on student communication styles
4. üåê Expand the dataset to include a more diverse range of students and educational contexts

By pursuing these avenues, researchers and educators can gain even deeper insights into student behavior and develop more effective, personalized learning strategies.
