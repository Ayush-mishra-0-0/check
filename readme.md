# Advanced EDA of Video Text Dataset

## Overview

This project presents an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a video text dataset, focusing on emotional and communication attributes of students. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, statistical tests, and feature importance analysis.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Correlation analysis of emotional and communication attributes
- Distribution analysis of various attributes
- Comparison of high-confidence vs low-confidence groups
- Analysis of enthusiastic students with neutral text scores
- Interactive visualizations (scatter plots)
- Statistical analysis (t-tests, ANOVA)
- Feature importance analysis for predicting speech speed

## Data

The dataset includes three main components:

1. Emotion data
2. Gaze data
3. Transcript data

Each component provides different insights into student behavior and communication patterns.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn

## Key Findings

- Strong correlation between confidence and positive emotions
- Significant difference between confident and hesitant scores
- No significant relationship between positive emotions and speech speed
- Hesitance and enthusiasm are the most important features for predicting speech speed
