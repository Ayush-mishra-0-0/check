Hiring Manager  
Microsoft Corporation  


Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Data Scientist position at Microsoft. As a B.Tech student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhilai, with a current CGPA of 9.06, I have honed a wide range of skills and developed expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis, which align with the requirements of this role.

During my academic journey, I have undertaken several impactful projects, including a **Sentiment Analysis Tool** for the G20 Summit using NLP techniques, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95.4%. This project not only allowed me to demonstrate my technical proficiency but also showcased my ability to derive meaningful insights from complex data. Additionally, my experience with Flask web applications and Kafka integration enabled me to build scalable systems with low latency, further enhancing my problem-solving abilities.

I am proficient in Python, C++, and various tools and frameworks such as Spark, AWS, React, and Docker. Moreover, my competitive programming background, with a Codeforces rating of 1605 and a 5-star rating on Codechef, has sharpened my analytical thinking and coding efficiency, which are essential skills for tackling challenging data science problems.

Beyond my technical expertise, I have also demonstrated leadership abilities, serving as a **Core Member** of the Inguenity Competitive Programming Club at IIT Bhilai and **Team Leader** at the Smart India Hackathon. These experiences have helped me develop strong collaboration and project management skills, ensuring that I can contribute effectively in a team-driven environment like Microsoft's.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Microsoft's cutting-edge data science initiatives and am confident that my skills and experiences will enable me to add value to your team. I am eager to discuss how I can contribute to Microsoft's mission of driving innovation and empowering individuals through data-driven solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your teamâ€™s needs in more detail.

Sincerely,  
Ayush Kumar Mishra
