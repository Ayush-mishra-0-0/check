To analyze the eye offset data and determine emotional stability, changes in emotions, and body language, you can follow this framework:
1. Emotional Stability Analysis
Objective: Determine how much a studentâ€™s eyes deviate throughout the video to gauge emotional stability.
Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation:
Compute the mean and standard deviation of the eye_offset for each student over the entire video.

Stability Metric: Lower standard deviation indicates more stability; higher indicates more fluctuation.

Cumulative Deviation:
Calculate the cumulative deviation over time to assess how the deviation accumulates.

Visualization:
Plot the eye_offset values over time to visualize stability.
Use rolling windows to smooth the data and highlight trends.

3. Emotional Variation Analysis
Objective: Analyze how emotions change over time within the video.

Calculate Moving Average:
Compute the moving average of the eye_offset to observe trends and variations.

Variation Metrics:
Measure the variance or standard deviation over time windows to capture emotional changes.

Visualization:
Create time series plots of eye_offset and its moving average.
Use heatmaps to show variation intensity over time.

4. Body Language Analysis
Objective: Analyze body language based on blink_sum, eye_offset, and gaze_score.

Correlate Metrics:
Compute correlations between eye_offset, blink_sum, and gaze_score.
Analyze how these metrics interact to provide insights into body language.

Blink Frequency:
Analyze the blink_sum to determine blinking patterns and their relation to emotional states.

Gaze Score Analysis:
Evaluate gaze_score to understand gaze direction and how it correlates with eye offset and blinking.

Body Language Patterns:
Combine all metrics to identify patterns such as increased blinking with large eye offsets or shifts in gaze.

Visualization:
Plot eye_offset, blink_sum, and gaze_score together to observe how they change over time.
Use scatter plots to explore correlations between metrics.
