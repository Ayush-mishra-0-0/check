Let's start with the EDA. I'll create a Python script to load and analyze the data. We'll use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.

This script performs the following tasks:

Loads the emotion and transcript data
Analyzes the emotion data to calculate average emotion scores, gaze, and blink information
Analyzes the transcript data to calculate average scores and speaking time
Combines the summaries from both datasets
Creates a function to plot emotion distribution over time for a candidate
Generates insights for each candidate based on their data
Prints the insights for all candidates
Plots the emotion distribution for the first candidate as an example


tell me more what i should do keeping those three question in mind


Excellent! You've already taken a great first step by creating a summary dataframe from the emotion and transcript data. This provides a good overview of the candidate's emotional states and communication metrics throughout the interview. To further analyze the data and address the three main questions, here are additional steps you can take:

Data Preparation and Integration:
a) Merge the gaze data with your current dataframe to include eye contact information.
b) Calculate the percentage of time the candidate maintained eye contact.
c) Normalize the speech speed data to categorize it as slow, medium, or fast.

Communication Skills Analysis:
a) Create a line plot showing the trends of avg_confident, avg_hesitant, and avg_speech_speed over time.
b) Calculate the correlation between confidence and speech speed.
c) Analyze the relationship between eye contact and confidence levels.
d) Create a word cloud from the transcript to identify frequently used words and phrases.

Emotional State Analysis:
a) Create a stacked area chart showing the progression of emotions throughout the interview.
b) Calculate the emotional stability by measuring the variance in emotional states.
c) Identify any patterns in emotional changes (e.g., does confidence increase as the interview progresses?).

Expertise Identification:
a) Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the transcript to extract key terms related to skills, technologies, and domain knowledge.
b) Create a frequency distribution of these terms to identify the most prominent areas of expertise.
c) Map the extracted skills to job requirements (if available) to assess the candidate's fit.

Decision Support Metrics:
a) Create a composite score for communication skills based on confidence, clarity (inverse of hesitancy), and appropriate speech speed.
b) Develop an "emotional intelligence" score based on the ability to maintain a positive or neutral emotional state.
c) Calculate the percentage of time spent discussing relevant experience and skills.

Comparative Analysis:
a) If data from other candidates is available, perform a comparative analysis of key metrics.
b) Create visualizations that show how this candidate ranks in various aspects compared to the average or top performers.

Insights Generation:
a) Identify the top 3 strengths and weaknesses based on the data.
b) Create a summary of the candidate's communication style (e.g., confident but occasionally hesitant, emotionally varied but generally positive).
c) List any red flags or areas of concern that require further investigation.

Recommendation Framework:
a) Develop a scoring system that weights different aspects (e.g., communication skills, relevant experience, emotional stability) based on job requirements.
b) Use this system to generate an overall recommendation score.
c) Create a decision matrix that maps ranges of scores to recommendations (e.g., "Strongly Recommend", "Recommend with Reservations", "Do Not Recommend").

Visualization Dashboard:
a) Create a comprehensive dashboard that includes key visualizations and metrics to support decision-making.
b) Include sections for communication skills, emotional analysis, expertise areas, and overall recommendation.

Further Investigation Points:
a) Identify specific moments in the interview (by timestamp) where unusual patterns occur (e.g., sudden emotional changes, dips in confidence).
b) Suggest follow-up questions or areas to explore in subsequent interviews based on the data analysis.

By following these steps, you'll be able to provide a data-driven answer to whether the candidate should be recruited, offer a detailed analysis of their communication skills and areas of expertise, and provide additional insights to support the hiring decision.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific step or provide code examples for implementing any of these analyses?




Integrate all datasets: Ensure the emotion, gaze, and transcript data are merged by movie_id and image_seq for consistency.
Communication Scoring:
Confidence: Use avg_confident as a key indicator. High values suggest the candidate communicates well.
Hesitancy: Use avg_hesitant to measure how much the candidate hesitates, which can indicate uncertainty.
Speech Speed: Check if the speech speed (avg_speech_speed) is within an acceptable range. Extremely fast or slow speeds might impact communication clarity.
Emotional Stability:
Look at the variance in dominant emotions (dominant_emotion_top1). Consistent positive or neutral emotions are a good sign.
Calculate emotional stability: Low variability in emotions like fear, sad, and angry across frames could indicate good emotional control.
Eye Contact (Gaze Data):
Analyze the percentage of frames where gaze=1 to see how engaged the candidate was. Poor eye contact could indicate disengagement or nervousness.
Summary of Behavioral Indicators:
Create a composite score that combines all these factors:
Confidence score
Emotional stability score
Gaze engagement score
Speech clarity score (based on speech speed and hesitancy)
2. Analysis of Communication Skills
Steps:
Trend Analysis:
Plot the evolution of avg_confident, avg_hesitant, and avg_speech_speed across the interview. This helps in understanding how the candidate's communication evolves. Does confidence increase, decrease, or remain steady?
Word Cloud Analysis:
Extract the text from the transcript data to identify commonly used words. A word cloud can help identify key terms, which could indicate areas of expertise or the candidateâ€™s communication tendencies.
Speech Clarity:
Conciseness: Use avg_concise to analyze if the candidate is precise or verbose. High conciseness is usually a positive indicator.
Enthusiasm: Analyze avg_enthusiastic to measure how positively the candidate comes across. Higher values can indicate good communication style.
Gaze & Confidence Correlation:
Use gaze data to see if there's a relationship between maintaining eye contact and confidence. For example, are confident moments linked to sustained gaze?
3. Other Insights to Aid Decision-Making
Steps:
Emotional Variability:
Analyze how emotional states (angry, fear, sad, etc.) fluctuate. Create a heatmap or stacked area chart for emotional states across the interview. Emotional consistency, especially neutrality or happiness, might indicate emotional intelligence.
Skills and Expertise Extraction:
Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) or other NLP techniques on the transcript data to identify specific skills, industry terms, or areas of expertise mentioned.
Topic Modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) could help identify key themes in the conversation.
Comparative Analysis:
If data from other candidates is available, compare this candidate's performance. Use the same metrics (confidence, speech speed, emotional stability) and create comparative visualizations.
Additional Insights:
Conciseness vs. Enthusiasm: See if the candidate can strike a balance between being concise and enthusiastic. High enthusiasm might be a strong positive, but too much verbosity could hurt clarity.
Emotional Response vs. Communication: Examine how dominant emotions shift during specific parts of the interview. For example, does fear increase during technical questions? Do emotions stabilize when discussing experience?
