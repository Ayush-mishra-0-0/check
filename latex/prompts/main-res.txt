Let's start with the EDA. I'll create a Python script to load and analyze the data. We'll use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.

Candidate Video Analysis Script

This script performs the following tasks:

Loads the emotion and transcript data
Analyzes the emotion data to calculate average emotion scores, gaze, and blink information
Analyzes the transcript data to calculate average scores and speaking time
Combines the summaries from both datasets
Creates a function to plot emotion distribution over time for a candidate
Generates insights for each candidate based on their data
Prints the insights for all candidates
Plots the emotion distribution for the first candidate as an example
Excellent! You've already taken a great first step by creating a summary dataframe from the emotion and transcript data. This provides a good overview of the candidate's emotional states and communication metrics throughout the interview. To further analyze the data and address the three main questions, here are additional steps you can take:

1. Data Preparation and Integration:
a) Merge the gaze data with your current dataframe to include eye contact information. b) Calculate the percentage of time the candidate maintained eye contact. c) Normalize the speech speed data to categorize it as slow, medium, or fast.

2. Communication Skills Analysis:
a) Create a line plot showing the trends of avg_confident, avg_hesitant, and avg_speech_speed over time. b) Calculate the correlation between confidence and speech speed. c) Analyze the relationship between eye contact and confidence levels. d) Create a word cloud from the transcript to identify frequently used words and phrases.

3. Emotional State Analysis:
a) Create a stacked area chart showing the progression of emotions throughout the interview. b) Calculate the emotional stability by measuring the variance in emotional states. c) Identify any patterns in emotional changes (e.g., does confidence increase as the interview progresses?).

4. Expertise Identification:
a) Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the transcript to extract key terms related to skills, technologies, and domain knowledge. b) Create a frequency distribution of these terms to identify the most prominent areas of expertise. c) Map the extracted skills to job requirements (if available) to assess the candidate's fit.

5. Decision Support Metrics:
a) Create a composite score for communication skills based on confidence, clarity (inverse of hesitancy), and appropriate speech speed. b) Develop an "emotional intelligence" score based on the ability to maintain a positive or neutral emotional state. c) Calculate the percentage of time spent discussing relevant experience and skills.

6. Comparative Analysis:
a) If data from other candidates is available, perform a comparative analysis of key metrics. b) Create visualizations that show how this candidate ranks in various aspects compared to the average or top performers.

7. Insights Generation:
a) Identify the top 3 strengths and weaknesses based on the data. b) Create a summary of the candidate's communication style (e.g., confident but occasionally hesitant, emotionally varied but generally positive). c) List any red flags or areas of concern that require further investigation.

8. Recommendation Framework:
a) Develop a scoring system that weights different aspects (e.g., communication skills, relevant experience, emotional stability) based on job requirements. b) Use this system to generate an overall recommendation score. c) Create a decision matrix that maps ranges of scores to recommendations (e.g., "Strongly Recommend", "Recommend with Reservations", "Do Not Recommend").

9. Visualization Dashboard:
a) Create a comprehensive dashboard that includes key visualizations and metrics to support decision-making. b) Include sections for communication skills, emotional analysis, expertise areas, and overall recommendation.

10. Further Investigation Points:
a) Identify specific moments in the interview (by timestamp) where unusual patterns occur (e.g., sudden emotional changes, dips in confidence). b) Suggest follow-up questions or areas to explore in subsequent interviews based on the data analysis.

By following these steps, you'll be able to provide a data-driven answer to whether the candidate should be recruited, offer a detailed analysis of their communication skills and areas of expertise, and provide additional insights to support the hiring decision.
