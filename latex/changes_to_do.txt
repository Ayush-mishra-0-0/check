Data Overview and Preprocessing:

Load and inspect the data structure
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately
Ensure data types are correct (e.g., numeric for scores, categorical for emotions)


Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, std dev, min, max) for numerical columns
Compute frequency distributions for categorical variables (e.g., dominant_emotion)


Emotion Analysis:

Analyze the distribution of dominant emotions across candidates
Calculate average scores for each emotion
Identify candidates with notably high or low scores in specific emotions


Gaze and Blink Analysis:

Calculate the percentage of time candidates maintain eye contact (gaze == 1)
Analyze blink frequency and its correlation with other variables


Transcript Analysis:

Analyze speech duration for each candidate
Calculate average scores for positive, negative, neutral sentiments
Examine confidence, hesitance, conciseness, and enthusiasm scores


Time-based Analysis:

Plot emotion scores over time to identify trends or patterns
Analyze how speech characteristics change throughout the introduction


Correlation Analysis:

Create a correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables
Look for interesting correlations, e.g., between emotion scores and speech characteristics


Visualization:

Create bar charts for emotion distributions
Use line plots to show score changes over time
Generate heatmaps for correlation analysis
Use scatter plots to explore relationships between variables


Text Analysis:

Perform basic text analysis on transcripts (word frequency, key phrases)
Analyze speech speed and its correlation with other variables


Candidate Comparison:

Create summary profiles for each candidate based on their scores
Identify top performers in different categories (e.g., most confident, most positive)


Insight Generation:

Based on the analysis, formulate insights about each candidate's strengths and weaknesses
Identify patterns that might indicate suitability for recruitment
